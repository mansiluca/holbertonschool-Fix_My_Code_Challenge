# Fix My Code Challenge

## Description
This repository contains the "Fix My Code Challenge" project. The main goal of this project is to fix existing code that has bugs or issues. This is a hands-on opportunity to explore different codebases, identify problems, and implement solutions.

## Background
In this project, we'll be jumping into an existing codebase and fixing it. The challenges can involve code in different programming languages, allowing us to practice our debugging skills across a variety of environments.

## Project Structure
* Each directory represents a specific challenge
* Code may be written in various languages including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.
* The goal is to fix the existing code without rewriting it from scratch

## Requirements
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All files should end with a new line
* A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the specific challenge directory
3. Read the README file in that directory to understand the issue
4. Fix the code while maintaining the original functionality
